*andrzej.sobecki@pg.edu.pl*

This example shows how to prepare simple client application that can consume data offered by a soap web services. The application is created mainly by three files. In the **RegionsConfiguration.java** are defined method for marshaling data and address of Web Service. The **RegionsClient.java** describe the main logic of application - create request and parse response. The example application uses also files that describes objects required by SOAP but they are generated automatically. 

## Build and run
Before you will build the example application you should run 09-spring-soap-ws-produce. In pom.xml file which is belongs to this example is defined how the maven should automatically generate soap objects based on the wsdl. URL to the WSDL file assumes that it is provided by the `http://localhost:8080/ws/regions.wsdl`. So after you run **09-spring-soap-ws-produce** application you could build and run this example using the following command `mvn spring-boot:run`. You should get information about which region you had request and which answer was generated by the web service.
